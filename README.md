TECH-A-THON:
This Weather forecasting project is made under TECH-A-THON , a Hackathon organised by ECE SOCIETY of BIT, Mesra

THEME : ML/AI
SUB-THEME : Weather Forecasting

We have selected theme of weather forecasting and from this we aim to solve temperatures variation problem (different variation in temperatures due to global warming and other factors).This project solely focuses on how to determine temperature,humidity,wind-speed and along with it small weather description.

How to use: 

Our  main aim was to make a user-friendly project.Here all temperature analysis will be done in just a click user just has to enter city and rest all is provided.It accesss current weather data for any location including over 200,000 cities ,collect and process weather data from different sources such as global and local weather models, satellites, radars and a vast network of weather stations JSON, XML, and HTML formats

Here is example on how result will be displayed. 

Steps To Use :

STEP 1
Enter name of City

STEP 2 
Suppose user adds city name : Delhi

Step 3 
Result

Boom !!! And the result is here.Here as we can see temperature, humidity , small description and wind speed is shown.
In this project we are using API for accuracy.Requests module is being used,we are importing it.Weather information such as current temperature, pressure, humiditywind speed,weather description and many others,of any place using thus making OpenWeatherMap API in python. It's realibility is between 90% and 100% and inaccuracy is about only 1%.

Our future plan ==>We plan to give a comparison of temperature analysis by graph and pie-charts for more usability of this website for different cities will be available.Along with it a temperature variation history of cities will be shown which can be used for research.We plan to add different temperatures analysis like temperature 5-hour weather forecast etc.Also for students we would like to add a rotating globe where they can click on any city and temperature will be shown accordingly.
